            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
                The vision behind EcoThreads was fueled by our desire to make sustainable fashion accessible to all. We recognized that clothing production takes a toll on our planet. For instance, the textile industry uses an estimated 79 billion cubic meters of water annually and 85% of textiles end up in landfills each year. Our goal was clear: to create an online community where people could easily post their second-hand clothing and find others who would appreciate them. By facilitating the exchange of clothing, we wanted to inspire a shift in consumer behavior, fostering a culture of reusing and reducing the demand for new clothes.

            <h3>How to Use EcoThreads</h3>
            <p>
                EcoThreads is a user-friendly online platform that allows users to easily post their old clothing for others to claim and wear. The website includes multiple pages so that users can register and sign in to an account, post and claim clothes, and learn more about being sustainable through clothing. It's a convenient and environmentally responsible way to give new life to pre-owned clothing, reduce the need for new production, and foster a community committed to sustainable living.
